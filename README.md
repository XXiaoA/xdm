## Install
### Releases
Download the file from [releases](https://github.com/XXiaoA/xdm/releases)

### Crates.io
Download from [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/xdm): `cargo install xdm`. And remember to add `~/.cargo/bin/` into your $PATH

### From source
Clone the source code with git. Then run `cargo install --path .`. And remember to add `~/.cargo/bin/` into your $PATH


## Usage
> Run `xdm -h` for more details

First you should create a **yaml** file named `xdm.yaml` (not prerequisite, but **recommend**).

Then you can run `xdm s` in a directory which has the yaml file. Xdm will find the `xdm.yaml` automatically in the current directory. Or you're able to use `xdm s file.yaml` to specify a yaml file.

Also, you can link a specific a directory or file. Check [here](#manual)


### Manual
You can set `manual` true in your link parameter (see [configuration](#configuration)).

If a link is manual, it won't be crated after run `xdm s`. But you can create it manually:
```shell
xdm link {path}
```

Also, `link` command can work in all links, whether it'is manual or not.

And you can crate all links with `xdm -a s`

### Add
You can use `add` command to add a link item into your configuration automatically. For example:
```shell
xdm a a
```

Then the following will add into your configuration:
```yaml
link:
  # add by xdm
  a:
    path: b
```

BTW, the link is added is absolutize. And it don't use a simple way: `a: b` in order to let you add other parameter more easily.

**Notice**: This feature will change your configuration. Your configuration probably be messy, but it still legal. Maybe fix it in the futrue.


## Configuration
For example:
```yaml
link:
  ./path-to-original-file:
    path: ./path-to-linked-file

  ./nvim: ~/repos/nvim

  ./tmux:
    path: ~/.tmux.conf
    if: test -e /usr/bin/tmux # for fish shell

create:
  - ~/repos
```
Notice: you must have `link` option.


###  Link
Link a file/directory.

What's more, the two following form is same, it can reduce your work:
```yaml
link:
  ./a:
    path: b

  ./a: b
```

| Parameter | Explanation                                           | type   | default |

| path      | The file path to linked file                          | string | \\      |
| exist     | Only create the link if the original file exists      | bool   | true    |
| force     | Create the link whether the linked file exists or not | bool   | false   |
| if        | Create the link if shell command is true (WIP)        | string | \\      |
| create    | Create the parent directory of link if need           | bool   | true    |
| manual    | Check [here](#manual)                                 | bool   | false   |
| relink    | Auto relink if the linked path is a link              | bool   | true    |

### Create
Create a directory


## Others
### Notice
Whether `path-to-linked-file` is a directory or file, it shouldn't end with `/`.

But `path-to-original-file` should end with `/` or not is base on yourself.
